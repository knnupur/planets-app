# PlanetsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Demo

This project is hosted at https://knnupur.github.io/planets-app/. However, due to erros in SPA deployment in Github pages, the demo site doesn't load up properly. I kept running into Jekyll related errors.

A demo of the project is recorded at : https://www.loom.com/share/41bc626997a540d99e6766fa4877350b

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
